# inventory-proxy-system
Proxy Pattern implementation for stock control application. Manages countable, measurable, and barcode products with lazy loading for database queries. Software Engineering Project.

Case:
Suppose that you are requested to develop an application for stock control. There are three types of stocks:
countable products, measurable products, and products with barcodes. The interface of the application
allows us to choose the product from the screen and its details (for example how many products are there,
price, image, category, and so on) are displayed on the screen by database query.
